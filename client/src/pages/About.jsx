          <h1 className=' mt-6 text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-slate-800'>Why Sell My Home on Miami Real Estate?</h1> 
           <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>
           Because no one knows your home better than you do. Why pay a real 
           estate agent to market your property when you can do it yourself with 
           the right resources and a little coaching? Selling by owner allows you 
           to control costs and fees, and recoup more of the home equity you’ve worked 
           so hard to build. Consider this: A homeowner selling a $300,000 house through
            a full-service real estate agent could expect to be charged a 6 percent commission
             (approximately $18,000), plus additional fees. Not only can you hang onto that money 
             selling by owner, you retain complete control of your listing.
